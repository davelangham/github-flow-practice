# github-flow-practice
This is a simple repository with an owner & 4 collaborators.
The object of this repo is to teach the members how to pull from
& push to a remote repository via a combination of command line interface,
for Git commands, & a web browser interface for GitHub.
In addition, it is also to practice working collaboratively by creating a Git branch
to add features & then raising pull requests to have them merged into the main branch.
